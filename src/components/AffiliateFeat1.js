          <h1>​Who Can Be An Affiliate?</h1>
          <p>
            ​Affiliate marketing is for everyone. Becoming an affiliate is one
            of the smartest things you can do if you want to take a hold of your
            own marketing future and digital career. Just like all great things
            in life, gaining expertise in affiliate marketing requires
            resiliency and hard work. Deliberate practice means that you will
            fail. A lot, of course a failure doesn’t mean that you’re a failure.
            Every second you spend investing in learning affiliate marketing
            will pay dividends down the line. It takes patience the same amount
            of patience for the stay-at-home mom, the high school graduate, the
            MBA holder, the retiree, and the former CEO. Everyone has to come to
            the table willing to see themselves through failure. Don’t worry
            though–it’s a big table, and luck for you, your seat is next to us.
