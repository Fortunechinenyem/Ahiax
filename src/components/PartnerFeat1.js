          <p>
            Simply put, Partner Marketing is where two or more businesses work
            together for a mutual benefit. Goals and incentives are 100% aligned
            and focused solely on results – it’s a beautiful thing. ​ At ElanX
            we have built a 360 ecosystem to help your business sales goals sky
            through the roof. One more thing, we like to put our money where our
            mouth is, we understand partnership is also bearing the risk.
